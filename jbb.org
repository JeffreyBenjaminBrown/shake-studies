* use fewer calls to need, if possible
** how: make the list argument to "need" longer
rather than calling it more than once in the same do-expression
** why: "multiple files required by a need can be built in parallel"
* cmd_ takes any number of space-separated args
cmd_ "gcc -o _make/run _build/main.o _build/constants.o"
cmd_ ["gcc","-o","_make/run","_build/main.o","_build/constants.o"]
* enclose unknown strings in []s
"To properly handle unknown string variables it is recommended to enclose them in a list, e.g. [out], so that even if out contains a space it will be treated as a single argument."
* avoid circularities
"You should only use getDirectoryFiles on source files, not files that are generated by the build system, otherwise the results will change while you are running the build and the build may be inconsistent."
* TODO `phony` is confusing to me
